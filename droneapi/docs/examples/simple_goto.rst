========================
Example: Simple Go To
========================

This little demonstration just tells the vehicle to fly to a couple of different locations in the world.  You can edit the code to pick a latitude and longitude close to your position.

Running the example
===================

Once Mavproxy is running and the API is loaded, you can run this small example by typing: ``api start simple_goto.py``

It will tell your vehicle to start flying to a particular latitude and longitude stored in the file (though for safety the take-off command is not included - you must manually tell vehicle to fly).  On the mavproxy console you should see:

::

	STABILIZE> api start simple_goto.py
	STABILIZE> Got MAVLink msg: MISSION_ACK {target_system : 255, target_component : 0, type : 0}
	GUIDED> Mode GUIDED
	APIThread-0 exiting...
	Got MAVLink msg: MISSION_ACK {target_system : 255, target_component : 0, type : 0}


How does it work?
=================

The key code in this demo is the following:

::

	vehicle.mode    = VehicleMode("GUIDED")
	origin          = Location(-34.364114, 149.166022, 30, is_relative=True)

	commands.goto(origin)
	vehicle.flush()

It tells the vehicle to fly to a specified lat/long and hover at that location (30 meters in the air).  ``is_relative=True`` is the default and is recommended - it means that the altitude (30 meters) is *relative* to the vehicle home location.  If you had set ``is_relative`` to ``false``, it would have told the vehicle to fly to a specified mean-sea-level which is probably not what you want unless you are next to an ocean.


Building on the basic vehicle control you just learned, we now show how to write a small web application that allows you to command a drone to fly to a particular location.
