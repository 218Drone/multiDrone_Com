# Demo: GUIDED Mode Setting Speed and Yaw

This example shows how to fly a vehicle in GUIDED mode, controlling movement by setting the vehicle speed components and yaw direction.

**Note:** Other approaches for guiding a vehicle are to set the target position in GUIDED mode (i.e. [simple goto](http://python.dronekit.io/example_1.html), [code here](https://github.com/diydrones/dronekit-python/blob/master/example/simple_goto/simple_goto.py)) or to use AUTO mode and set waypoints. The approach in this example is useful when the precise position of the target is unknown.


## Running the example

Once MAVProxy is running and the API is loaded, you can run the example by typing: ```api start full_path_to_file``` 

If you started the DroneKit MAVProxy prompt in a directory containing the example script you can start it using: ```api start guided_set_speed_yaw.py```. Otherwise you may have to specify the full path (something like): ```api start /home/user/git/dronekit-python/example/guided_set_speed_yaw/guided_set_speed_yaw.py```. 

The program will automatically arm the vehicle and start the demo. First it waits for a GPS lock (```Waiting for GPS...```), then to receive a location update (```Waiting for location...```) and finally it arms the vehicle (```Arming...``` and ```Waiting for arming cycle completes...```). The vehicle will then lift off and ascend 5 meters. It flies at a constant speed in a square path (North, East, South, West) and then in a diamond-shaped path. While following the square path, the heading of the vehicle is changed according to the flying direction; while following the diamond-shaped path, the heading remains fixed. When it has completed both paths, the vehicle lands.

If it does not arm, type ```arm throttle``` manually in the MAVProxy console.

After starting the simulator, the console output should look something like:

```

## How does it work?

The GUIDED mode allows a vehicle to fly autonomously without a predefined a mission. This enables a GCS (ground control station) or a companion computer to control the vehicle "on the fly", reacting to new events or situations as they occur.

The example uses this mode, and calls the  [SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED](https://pixhawk.ethz.ch/mavlink/#SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED) and [MAV_CMD_CONDITION_YAW](http://planner.ardupilot.com/wiki/common-mavlink-mission-command-messages-mav_cmd/#mav_cmd_condition_yaw) commands to control the vehicle direction and speed.

The key code is captured in the following functions:

```
# send_nav_velocity - send nav_velocity command to vehicle to request it fly in specified direction
def send_nav_velocity(velocity_x, velocity_y, velocity_z):
    # create the SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED command
    # Check https://pixhawk.ethz.ch/mavlink/#SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED
    # for info on the type_mask (0=enable, 1=ignore).
    # Accelerations and yaw are ignored in GCS_Mavlink.pde at the
    # time of writing.
    msg = vehicle.message_factory.set_position_target_local_ned_encode(
        0,       # time_boot_ms (not used)
        0, 0,    # target system, target component
        mavutil.mavlink.MAV_FRAME_BODY_NED, # frame
        0b0000111111000111, # type_mask (only speeds enabled)
        0, 0, 0, # x, y, z positions (not used)
        velocity_x, velocity_y, velocity_z, # x, y, z velocity in m/s
        0, 0, 0, # x, y, z acceleration (not supported yet, ignored in GCS_Mavlink.pde)
        0, 0)    # yaw, yaw_rate (not supported yet, ignored in GCS_Mavlink.pde) 
    # send command to vehicle
    vehicle.send_mavlink(msg)
    vehicle.flush()

# condition_yaw - send condition_yaw mavlink command to vehicle so it points at specified heading (in degrees)
def condition_yaw(heading):
    # create the CONDITION_YAW command
    msg = vehicle.message_factory.mission_item_encode(0, 0,  # target system, target component
            0,     # sequence
            mavutil.mavlink.MAV_FRAME_GLOBAL_RELATIVE_ALT, # frame
            mavutil.mavlink.MAV_CMD_CONDITION_YAW,         # command
            2, # current - set to 2 to make it a guided command
            0, # auto continue
            heading,    # param 1, yaw in degrees
            0,          # param 2, yaw speed deg/s
            1,          # param 3, direction -1 ccw, 1 cw
            0,          # param 4, relative offset 1, absolute angle 0
            0, 0, 0)    # param 5 ~ 7 not used
    # send command to vehicle
    vehicle.send_mavlink(msg)
    vehicle.flush()
```

The function ``send_nav_velocity()`` generates a ``SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED`` MAVLink message which is used to directly specify the speed components to the vehicle.

When using ``mavutil.mavlink.MAV_FRAME_BODY_NED``, the speed components ``vx`` and ``vy`` are parallel to the North and East directions, not to the the front and side of the vehicle. The ``v``z component is perpendicular to the plane of ``vx`` and ``vy``, with a positive value towards the ground, following the right-hand convention. For more information about this frame of reference, see this wikipedia article on [NED](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_east_down).

The ``type_mask`` parameter is a bitmask to indicate which dimensions are used/ignored by the vehicle (0 means that the dimension is enabled, 1 means ignored). In the example the value 0b0000111111000111 is used to enable the speed components.

The function ``condition_yaw()`` generates a [MISSION_ITEM](https://pixhawk.ethz.ch/mavlink/#MISSION_ITEM) message carrying a ``MAV_CMD_CONDITION_YAW`` payload. It allows to specify a yaw direction for the vehicle. In the example, absolute angles are used. Therefore a heading of 0 means North.
